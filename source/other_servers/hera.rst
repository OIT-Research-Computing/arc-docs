Hera(.rc.pdx.edu) is a server that you can use to connect to research servers (Circe/Hecate/Hydra) from off campus. Hera is accessable without PSU's VPN service.

Connecting to another research server from Hera:
================================================

  1. first, ``ssh`` into Hera from your local machine
  2. then, ``ssh`` onto the server that you want to use
  
And there you have it. That is all you need to do to connect to our infastructure from the outside world.
