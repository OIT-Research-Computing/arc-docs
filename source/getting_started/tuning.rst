Choosing number of threads to use for a program
===============================================

The optimal number of threads to use is entirely dependent on the program being run and may take a bit of trial and error. More threads does not usually result in faster runs and can actually be detrimental.

Please limit the number of threads to half of the currently available on the compute server.
