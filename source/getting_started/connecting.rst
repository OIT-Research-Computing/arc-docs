Connecting to a Server
**********************

The research systems are accessed primarily through use of a command-line interface utilizing a secure shell (SSH). For information on how to use this go here:

 - `Using SSH <http://www.pdx.edu/oit/secure-shell-ssh>`_

To connect to the research servers, first connect to `research.pdx.edu`.
From here you can connect to the compute servers::

  $ ssh user@circe.rc.pdx.edu
  $ ssh user@hecate.rc.pdx.edu
  $ ssh user@hydra.rc.pdx.edu
