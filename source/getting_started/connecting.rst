Connecting to a Server
**********************

.. TODO: Write a step by step tutorial here on how to do this.

The research systems are accessed primarily through use of a command-line interface utilizing a secure shell (SSH). For information on how to use this go here:

 - `Using SSH <http://www.pdx.edu/oit/secure-shell-ssh>`_

OSX/Linux/Unix
==============

Use your system provided terminal program to connect to ARC research servers using ``SSH``.

Windows
=======

Use `putty`_ to connect to ARC research servers.


Off Campus?
===========

The research servers can only be connected to on campus.  If you wish to connect to the research servers off campus, you have two options:

- `PSUs VPN <http://www.pdx.edu/oit/virtual-private-network-vpn>`_
- Connecting to :ref:`hera` (``rc.pdx.edu``) then connecting to the research server of your choice from that connection.
